# Awesome Machine Learning Model Management Frameworks
This repository lists various frameworks and tools which support developing and managing machine learning models.
* [Comet](https://www.comet.ml): Track code, experiments and results on ML projects
* [DVC](https://dvc.org): Version control system for machine learning projects
* [Flor](https://flor.readthedocs.io): Logger and automatic version controller for data scientists
* [Guild AI](https://guild.ai): Run, track, and compare machine learning experiments
* [MLflow](https://mlflow.org): Platform for the machine learning lifecycle
* [Sacred](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): Configure, organize, log and reproduce computational experiments


For an extensive evaluation of DVC, MLflow and Sacred have a look at the blog post [Frameworks for Machine Learning Model Management](https://www.inovex.de/blog/machine-learning-model-management/) by [Nico Kreiling](https://github.com/krlng).
